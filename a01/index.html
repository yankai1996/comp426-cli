				Yellow Emperor
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Yellow Emperor, also known as the Yellow Thearch, or by his Chinese name Huangdi (/ˈhwɑːŋ ˈdiː/), is a
				deity (shen) in Chinese religion, one of the legendary Chinese sovereigns and culture heroes included among the
				mytho-historical Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors and cosmological Five Forms of the Highest Deity. Calculated by Jesuit missionaries on the basis of Chinese chronicles
				and later accepted by the twentieth-century promoters of a universal calendar starting with the Yellow Emperor,
				Huangdi's traditional reign dates are 2697–2597 or 2698–2598 BCE.
			</p>

				Huangdi's cult became prominent in the late Warring States and early Han dynasty, when he was portrayed as the originator of the centralized state, as a cosmic ruler, and as a patron of esoteric arts. A large number of texts – such as the Huangdi Neijing, a medical classic, and the Huangdi Sijing, a group of political treatises – were thus attributed to him. Having waned in influence during most of the imperial period, in the early twentieth century Huangdi became a rallying figure for Han Chinese attempts to overthrow the rule of the Qing dynasty, which they considered foreign because its emperors were Manchu people. To this day the Yellow Emperor remains a powerful symbol within Chinese nationalism.

				Traditionally credited with numerous inventions and innovations – ranging from the Chinese calendar to an ancestor of football – the Yellow Emperor is now regarded as the initiator of Chinese culture,and said to be the ancestor of all Chinese.
