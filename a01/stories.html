			<h2>
				Birth
			</h2>
			<p>
				According to Huangfu Mi (215–282), the Yellow Emperor was born in Shou Qiu ("Longevity Hill"),
				which is today on the outskirts of the city of Qufu in Shandong. Early on, he lived with his tribe near
				the Ji River – Edwin Pulleyblank states that "there seems to be no record of a Ji River outside the
				myth" – and later migrated to Zhuolu in modern-day Hebei. He then became a farmer and tamed six
				different special beasts: the bear (熊), the brown bear (罴; 羆), the pí (貔) and xiū (貅) (which later
				combined to form the mythical Pixiu), the ferocious chū (貙), and the tiger (虎).
			</p>
			<p>
				Huangdi is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived
				him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the Big Dipper. She
				delivered her son on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named.

			<h2>
				Achievements
			</h2>
			<p>
				In traditional Chinese accounts, the Yellow Emperor is credited with improving the livelihood of the nomadic
				hunters of his tribe. He teaches them how to build shelters, tame wild animals, and grow the Five Grains,
				although other accounts credit Shennong with the last. He invents carts, boats, and clothing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other inventions credited to the emperor include the Chinese diadem (冠冕), throne rooms (宮室), the bow sling,
				early Chinese astronomy, the Chinese calendar, math calculations, code of sound laws (音律),[106] and cuju, an
				early Chinese version of football. He is also sometimes said to have been partially responsible for the
				invention of the guqin zither, although others credit the Yan Emperor with inventing instruments for Ling
				Lun's compositions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In traditional accounts, he also goads the historian Cangjie into creating the first Chinese character writing
				system, the Oracle bone script, and his principal wife Leizu invents sericulture and teaches his people how to
				weave silk and dye clothes.
			</p>
			<p>
				At one point in his reign the Yellow Emperor allegedly visited the mythical East sea and met a talking beast
				called the Bai Ze who taught him the knowledge of all supernatural creatures. This beast explained to
				him there were 11,522 (or 1,522) kinds of supernatural creatures.

			<h2>
				Battles
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor were both leaders of a tribe or a combination of two tribes near the
				Yellow River. The Yan Emperor hailed from a different area around the Jiang River, which a geographical work
				called the Shuijingzhu identified as a stream near Qishan in what was the Zhou homeland before they defeated the
				Shang. Both emperors lived in a time of warfare.[112] The Yan Emperor proving unable to control the
				disorder within his realm, the Yellow Emperor took up arms to establish his domination over various warring
				factions.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to traditional accounts, the Yan Emperor meets the force of the "Nine Li" (九黎) under their
				bronze-headed leader, Chi You, and his 81 horned and four-eyed brothers and suffers a decisive defeat. He
				flees to Zhuolu and begs the Yellow Emperor for help. During the ensuing Battle of Zhuolu the Yellow Emperor
				employs his tamed animals and Chi You darkens the sky by breathing out a thick fog. This leads the emperor to
				develop the south-pointing chariot, which he uses to lead his army out of the miasma. He next calls upon the
				drought demon Nüba to dispel Chi You's storm. He then destroys the Nine Li and defeats Chi You.[113] Later he
				engages in battle with the Yan Emperor, defeating him at Banquan and replacing him as the primary ruler.[112]

				Death
			</h2>
			<p>
				TThe Yellow Emperor was said to have lived for over a hundred years before meeting a phoenix and a qilin and
				then dying. Two tombs were built in Shaanxi within the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, in addition to
				others in Henan, Hebei and Gansu.
			</p>
			<p>
				Modern-day Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as the "Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor", although
				non-Han minority groups in China may have their own myths or not count as descendants of the emperor.
